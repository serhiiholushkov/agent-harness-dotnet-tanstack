# Rules

Rules are the durable standards code in this repository must always meet. A rule states the standard and what catches violations — it never contains procedure (that is a skill's job) and never narrates rationale beyond a sentence (that is [../docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md)'s job).

## Format

Every rule file is one topic, ≤ ~80 lines, imperative and testable, with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Module boundaries
description: One-line summary used for indexes and discovery.
appliesTo: 'apps/api/**/*.cs'
---
```

`appliesTo` is a comma-separated list of glob hints relative to the consuming repository root. Installation maps it to each harness's scoping mechanism (Copilot `applyTo` frontmatter, Cursor rule globs, Claude selective installation). Harnesses without file scoping load the whole installed pack.

## Packs

Always-loaded context is expensive; install only the packs an agent's role needs.

| Pack                       | Covers                                                                       | Scope                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [common/](common/)         | Boundaries, naming, error shape, security, commits — the cross-stack floor   | Everything             |
| [csharp/](csharp/)         | C# language discipline: nullability, async, `Result`, EF Core, logging       | `apps/api/**/*.cs`     |
| [dotnet-api/](dotnet-api/) | Modules, slices, endpoint/OpenAPI metadata, data ownership, options, caching | `apps/api/**/*.cs`     |
| [typescript/](typescript/) | TS strictness, type sourcing, async/error handling, module resolution        | `**/*.ts(x)`           |
| [web/](web/)               | Feature folders, routes, TanStack Query, server functions, components        | `apps/web/**`          |
| [monorepo/](monorepo/)     | pnpm/Turbo wiring, the codegen pipeline, the command surface                 | Root configs, pipeline |
| [testing/](testing/)       | Test placement, the test-type tables, discipline                             | Test files             |

Role combinations:

| Agent role           | Install                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Full-stack (default) | All seven packs                                      |
| API-only             | `common` + `csharp` + `dotnet-api` + `testing`       |
| Web-only             | `common` + `typescript` + `web` + `testing`          |
| Reviewer / planner   | `common` + `monorepo` (plus read access to the rest) |

## Installation

The catalog here is canonical; installed copies are disposable and regenerated, never edited in place.

- **GitHub Copilot** — copy each rule to `.github/instructions/<pack>-<name>.instructions.md` and translate `appliesTo` into the `applyTo` frontmatter key.
- **Claude Code** — copy selected packs to `.claude/rules/` and translate `appliesTo` into the `paths` frontmatter key, or import pack files from `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Codex and other AGENTS.md readers** — link the packs from the root `AGENTS.md`; the contract file already points here.
- **Cursor** — convert to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` and translate `appliesTo` into rule `globs`.

Exact per-harness destinations and steps live in [../docs/install.md](../docs/install.md); verify against each harness's current documentation when installing.
